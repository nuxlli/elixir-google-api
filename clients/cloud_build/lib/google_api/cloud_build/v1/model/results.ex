  Artifacts created by the build pipeline.

  ## Attributes

  - artifactManifest (String.t): Path to the artifact manifest. Only populated when artifacts are uploaded. Defaults to: `null`.
  - buildStepImages ([String.t]): List of build step digests, in the order corresponding to build step indices. Defaults to: `null`.
  - buildStepOutputs ([binary()]): List of build step outputs, produced by builder images, in the order corresponding to build step indices.  [Cloud Builders](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/cloud-builders) can produce this output by writing to &#x60;$BUILDER_OUTPUT/output&#x60;. Only the first 4KB of data is stored. Defaults to: `null`.
  - images ([BuiltImage]): Container images that were built as a part of the build. Defaults to: `null`.
  - numArtifacts (String.t): Number of artifacts uploaded. Only populated when artifacts are uploaded. Defaults to: `null`.
